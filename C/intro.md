# Introduction
    
<!--current page 15-->
    
- I prefer 1983 ANSI C (K&R 2nd).
    
- C was born for UNIX
  - C is machine independent
  - C is simple and concise (even though program with it is complicated)
  
- Creator's words
  - > C is a general-purpose programming language which features economy of expression, modern control flow and data structures, and a rich set of operators.    
  - > C wears well as one's experience with it grows     
    
- standard library
  - input output
  - memory management
  - string manipulation
  - etc

- What C provides
  - data types
    - characters
    - integers
    - floating point numbers
    - and hierarchy of derived data types created with pointers, arrays, structures, and unions
  - expressions are formed from operators and operands
    - any expression, including an assignment or a function call, cam be statement
  - pointers provide for machine-independent address arithmetic
  - control-flow
    - statement grouping
    - decision making (if-else)
    - selecting one of a set of possible cases (switch)
    - looping 
      - with the termination test at the top (while, for)
      - with the termination test at the bottom (do)
      - early loop exit (break)
      - early loop skip (continue)
  - Function
    - returns data type
    - may be called recursively
  - Local variables are automatic
