# Intro and Philosophy

## History of UE
- **visual based complete toolset**
- **level centric**
- started from **level editor**
- **other tools added-on** level editor, and then it called as engine

### UE1 (1997/1999)
- Called as _UnrealEd1, UnrealEd2_
- BSP Brush focused
- Engine struct was formulated
  - Actors, Viewport, Camera controls, toolbar...
  - Lighting rendered in viewport
- Event/Tag scripted
- Subtractive world (Skybox)

### UE2 (2002)
- Meshes added
  - BSP-Mesh hybrid workflow
- Event/Tag scripted
- Subtractive world (Skybox)
- used Ctrl+S to subtract (prevent spam)

### UE3 (2006)
- Visual scripting (Kismet) added
- sub-editors added
  - Matinee, Cascade, Material editor, etc
- Additive world (no Skybox)
- UE4's structure was almost completed

### UE4 (2014)
- Blueprint added
- UI revamp
- 2nd generation sub-editors and tools
  - Matinee and Cascade are replaced
  - Sequencer, Sound cue editor, etc
  - Unified interface with blueprint

### UE5 (2022)
- Lumen, Nanite added
- Reinforced sub-editors and open world support
  - Chaos, Niagara, AFPA, World Partition, etc


## Schematic-Schematic
> **All required tools and sub-editors are part of the editor and engine.**    
- for same team, same style, same logic
- to work together seamlessly

> **WYSIWYG**
- fully visual
- not text based scripting/programming
  - not only for programmers
  - speed up world production
    - posititate experimentation, qualty, diversity
