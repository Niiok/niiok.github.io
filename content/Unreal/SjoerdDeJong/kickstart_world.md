# Intro and Philosophy

## History of UE
- **visual based complete toolset**
- **level centric**
- started from **level editor**
- **other tools added-on** level editor, and then it called as engine

### UE1 (1997/1999)
- Called as _UnrealEd1, UnrealEd2_
- BSP Brush focused
- Engine struct was formulated
  - Actors, Viewport, Camera controls, toolbar...
  - Lighting rendered in viewport
- Event/Tag scripted
- Subtractive world (Skybox)

### UE2 (2002)
- Meshes added
  - BSP-Mesh hybrid workflow
- Event/Tag scripted
- Subtractive world (Skybox)
- used Ctrl+S to subtract (prevent spam)

### UE3 (2006)
- Visual scripting (Kismet) added
- sub-editors added
  - Matinee, Cascade, Material editor, etc
- Additive world (no Skybox)
- UE4's structure was almost completed

### UE4 (2014)
- Blueprint added
- UI revamp
- 2nd generation sub-editors and tools
  - Matinee and Cascade are replaced
  - Sequencer, Sound cue editor, etc
  - Unified interface with blueprint

### UE5 (2022)
- Lumen, Nanite added
- Reinforced sub-editors and open world support
  - Chaos, Niagara, AFPA, World Partition, etc


## Schematic-Schematic
> **All required tools and sub-editors are part of the editor and engine.**    
- for same team, same style, same logic
- to work together seamlessly

> **WYSIWYG**
- fully visual
- not text based scripting/programming
  - not only for programmers
  - speed up world production
    - posititate experimentation, qualty, diversity



# Schematic Overview

## Placable Actors excluding 3D
- Audio Actors
- Emitter Actors
  - Cascade particle or Niagara particle
- Reflection Captures
  - Sphere, Box, Planar
- Light Actors
  - Point, Rectangular, Spot, Directional, Sky
  - Static, Stationary, Dynamic(Movable)
- Volumes
  - Represent Area of something or somewhat, somehow
  - Geometry Editing available
- BP Actors
  - Used for both Gameplay and Workflow (not only for programmers)
- Gameplay/Other
  - Trigger, Maker, Spawn(e.g. player start), Decal, etc

## Placable 3D Actors
- Static Meshes
  - without some exceptions(e.g. vertex shader), theres no change like bone animation
  - HLOD : composit meshes into one, so that reduce drawcall
  - Instanced Static Meshes : Batching meshes to render
  - Splines : revole/deform static mesh
- Skeletal Meshes
  - Meshes with bone
- Geometry
  - Geometry Editing available
  - Binary Space Partition (BSP)
  - almost deprecated
- Procedural Mesh
  - available with plugin
  - generated at runtime
- Foliage
  - Foliage Tool
    - automatically batched
  - Grass 
    - automatically generated by landscape material layer
    - uses landscape's lighting (good for performance)
  - Procedural Foliage
    - experimental
	- automatically generated in foliage volume
	- poliage type (imitate real nature)
- Geometry Collections
  - Chaos Destructibles
- Landscapes
  - Layer, Components, Gizmos, Visibility, Painting, Sculpting, etc
  - Landscape Splines
  - Landmass Plugin
    - Landscape Brushes
- Skies
  - Static mesh and Material
  - new : Physical based Sky Atmosphere

## 3D Tools
- Import
- Modeling Tools
  - Sculpting Tools
- UV Tools
- Mesh Simplification
  - can be used for generating LOD

## Controls the Level
- World Properties
- Level Blueprint
  - Timeline
  - good for simple animations(changes)
- Variants Manager
  - can assign any property
  - `ce` on console to test
- Sequencer
  - used for movie or cutscene
  - can handle almost kind of values
  - Sequence Template

## Rebuilding
- Lighting
  - Lightmass Importance Volume
    - Lightmaps
	- Volumetric Lightmaps
  - Precomputed Visibility
- HLOD
- Reflection Captures
- Navmesh
  - Navmsh Agent
  - "Build Paths"
  - Runtime Navmesh (not pre-built)

## Sub-Level
### For
- great for co-work
- Devide by location
- Devide by actor type
- Light Scenarios
  - set different lights in individual sublevels
### How to load
- Blueprint (LoadStreamLevel)
  - also code
- Volumes
- Always Loaded
- World Composition
  - load automatically by instigator's distance (x and y, but not z)
  - good for open world

## Performance
- Stats
  - since UE2
  - type `stat [command]` in console
  - e.g. `scenerendering`, `none`, `game`, `physics`, `FPS`, `unit`
- GPU Profiler
  - `Ctrl + Shift + ,` or `Profile GPU` to open
- Statistics Panel
  - good for performance optimizing
- View Modes
  - can check complexity
- Cull/Max Draw Distance
- Scalability
- World Detail
  - since UE1 or UE2
  - can tag visual effects with rate



# Advice

- Multi user editing is available with editor server
  - without source controls

## Level organization
- Important actor standards
  - Editor Billdboard Scale
- Outliner
  - since UE4 (not familiar with old devs)
- Groups
  - `Ctrl` `Shift` `G`
  - doesn't affect on rendering and outliner (not batch)
- Layers
  - actually not layer
  - one actor can be contained in multiple layers
  - useful for selecting
- Selection tools
  - right clikc on actor for a lot of options
  - `Ctrl + B` open mesh in content browser
    - asset action
  - can select in Statistics Panel too

## Level cleanliness
- Rotation and scale
- Grid and snapping
  - can customize snap unit
  - Brackets(snap unit in/decrease) are good shortcut for preventing movement mistake
- Shadows/Collision

## Landscapes
- LOD and Collision
- Component setting
- Material complexity change and Shared Sampler
- Distance Fading scale/textures
- Hard blends

## Foliage
- Foliage Assets
- Range and Shadow
  - removing shadow is recommended
  - reducing rendering range is recommended
- Lower position material trick
  - cognitive trick
- Slope material trick

## Painting Tools
- it's material tricks

## Questions
- is light mass volume needed in raytrace?
  - not need in fully dynamic lights
  - but raytrace is not every-solution
- co-working on sublevel
  - sublevel can share same transform
